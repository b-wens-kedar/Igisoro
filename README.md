## Description

This game is a replica of the Igisoro/Urubugu board game which is a two-player variant of the mancala game family. It is a variant of the Omweso game of the Baganda people (Uganda), and it is played primarily in Burundi and Rwanda. Igisoro, like Omweso and other mancalas from Eastern Africa such as Bao (game), is played with a 4 by 8 board of pits and 64 seeds. A player's territory is the two rows of pits closest to them.

## The Rules

### Game Start

In this version each player starts with 4 seeds in each pit in the back row of their territory (the inner pits). However, traditionally any player may decide to start with seeds in their front row, or with some seeds in either row depending on their wishes and/or strategy.

### Playing and Turns.

On their turn, a player chooses a pit containing at least two seeds in their territory, this sows the seeds in that pit placing one seed in each adjacent pit counter-clockwise around their territory.

At the end of a turn, there are two ways in which the players turn may continue:

- If the pit where the last seed is sown is not empty, the player picks up all seeds from this pit and begins to sow again, starting from the next pit.
- If the pit where the last seed is sown is not empty and both opponent's opposite pits are not empty, the player picks up all seeds from these two opponent's pits and begins to sow again from the position where the last/original sowing began.

### Completion

The game is over when one player manages to capture enough of the opponent's seeds such that the losing player cannot sow any of their seeds. i.e They only have a maximum of one seed in any populated pits, hence can not sow/move.
